## 🎯 Research Questions

**Primary RQ**: What theoretical frameworks, empirical evidence, and practical applications exist for decolonial approaches to AI in education grounded in African, Indigenous, and Black radical pedagogical traditions?

**Sub-Questions**:
1. How do African-centered pedagogies (Afrocentricity, African-centered education) inform educational AI design?
2. What Indigenous West African epistemologies (Sankofa, Ubuntu, Ifá) offer alternative frameworks for AI systems?
3. How does critical pedagogy and Black radical tradition shape decolonial AI praxis?
4. What measurement and assessment frameworks exist that challenge colonial logics in educational AI?
