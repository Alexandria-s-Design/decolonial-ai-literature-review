## 5. Critical Race Theory & AI

### Adjin-Tettey, T. D., Perryman, A., & Moore, C. (2024). "We're changing the system with this one": Black students using critical race algorithmic literacies to subvert and survive AI-mediated racism in school. *English Teaching: Practice and Critique*, 23(1). https://doi.org/10.1108/ETPC-08-2023-0102

**Abstract**: This 2024 study centers experiences of three cohorts (n=40) of Black high school students who participated in a critical race technology course exposing anti-Blackness as the organizing logic of digital and AI technology. Introduces a new type of digital literacy: critical race algorithmic literacy, rooted in critical race technology theory, which theorizes Blackness as a technology and critiques algorithmic anti-Blackness.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates how K-12 students can develop critical literacies to resist and reimagine algorithmic systems.

---

### Cave, S., & Dihal, K. (2020). The Whiteness of AI. *Philosophy & Technology*, 33, 685–703.

**Abstract**: Drawing on Critical Race Theory, this paper examines how AI has been predominantly portrayed as White in humanoid robots, chatbots, virtual assistants, stock images, and film. Offers three interpretations: the normalization of Whiteness allowing it to reproduce itself; AI being racialized as White because it possesses qualities associated with Whiteness (intelligence, professionalism, power); and the Whiteness of machines permitting the White utopian imagination to erase people of color.

**K-12 Relevance**: Accessible analysis of racial representation in AI useful for media literacy education.

---

### Dixon-Román, E., Nichols, T. P., & Nyame-Mensah, A. (2019). The racializing forces of/in AI educational technologies. *Learning, Media & Technology*, 44(3), 312–324.

**Abstract**: According to Professor Dixon-Román at Columbia Teachers College, computational methods have potential to radically change public policy and educational services, yet cybernetic systems do have sociopolitical implications. Although these automated systems are purported to be more efficient and objective than humans, technologies are masking the reproduction of inequalities and social histories of sociopolitical violence.

**K-12 Relevance**: Connects AI in education to broader patterns of racialized harm, essential for educator professional development.

---

## 6. Feminist & Intersectional Approaches

### Noble, S. U. (2025). Black feminism and artificial intelligence: The possibilities and limitations of contesting discriminatory AI from a critical social theory perspective. *Frontiers in Sociology*, 10. https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2025.1602947

**Abstract**: Particularly powerful critiques of AI include scholarly works inspired by US-American Black feminism, a theory and practice developed by Black women to theorize and protest oppression at the intersection of race, gender, and class. Black feminism enables an intersectional analysis that foregrounds AI's impact on technology stakeholders at the intersection of race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, and more.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates how intersectional frameworks reveal multiple overlapping forms of AI bias.

---

### Hicks, M., Nagpal, R., Barocas, S., & Levy, K. (2021). Ethical data curation for AI: An approach based on feminist epistemology and critical theories of race. In *Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society* (pp. 695–703). https://doi.org/10.1145/3461702.3462598

**Abstract**: This paper proposes an ethical data curation approach grounded in feminist epistemology and critical race theories. Feminist, queer, and critical race theories are used to examine and critique AI systems, addressing relationships between gender, race, class, and technology.

**K-12 Relevance**: Provides frameworks for teaching students about how knowledge production in AI is shaped by power relations.

---

### Toupin, S. (2024). Shaping feminist artificial intelligence. *Information, Communication & Society*, 27(2), 287–302. https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448221150776

**Abstract**: Feminist AI (FAI) is often used as a placeholder to describe critical work addressing relationships between gender and technology, and at times, at the intersection of race and class. This use of FAI signals that feminist, queer, and critical race theories are being used to examine and critique AI systems.

**K-12 Relevance**: Introduces students to how feminist theories inform more equitable technology design.

---

### Wajcman, J., & Jones, R. (2023). Feminism confronts AI: The gender relations of digitalisation. In *Feminist AI: Critical perspectives on algorithms, data, and intelligent machines*. Oxford Academic. https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780192227355.003.0001

**Abstract**: Contributors bring interdisciplinary feminist insights from disciplines including postcolonial studies, disability theory, and Black Marxist theory to confront ageism, racism, sexism, ableism, and class-based oppressions in AI. This book emerged from the Gender and Technology Project at the University of Cambridge.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates how multiple theoretical lenses can illuminate different dimensions of AI harm.

---

## 7. Global South Perspectives & Governance

### Tironi, M., & Albornoz, C. (2025). Decolonizing AI? Lessons from a failed experiment. *Big Data & Society*, 12(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517251365224

**Abstract**: This article reflects on a failed speculative design intervention that sought to decolonize AI imaginaries, drawing on Latin American contexts. A speculative workshop in Santiago de Chile with AI and smart cities professionals aimed to explore generating alternative imaginaries of AI—visions that move beyond homogeneous narratives of technological futures.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates the challenges of decolonizing AI and the importance of learning from failures.

---

### Ooko, G. A. (2025). Toward a decolonial framework for communicating AI in African public service. *Emerging Media: Studies in Media and Communication*. https://doi.org/10.1177/27523543251374174

**Abstract**: Through a decolonial perspective, including insights from two cases (Mbaza Chatbot in Rwanda and Masakhane NLP project), this paper develops a decolonial framework to guide communication about AI in public service delivery. Literature synthesis shows that communication systems in African public service are embedded in colonial legacies of poor technology infrastructure, inadequate internet access and digital literacy, and language exclusion.

**K-12 Relevance**: Provides concrete examples of decolonial AI practice in African contexts.

---

### Kazim, E., et al. (2024). Decolonizing global AI governance: Assessment of the state of decolonized AI governance in Sub-Saharan Africa. *Royal Society Open Science*, 11(8). https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.231994

**Abstract**: Global AI governance must prioritize equity, embrace a decolonial mindset, and provide Global South countries the authority to spearhead solution creation. Results show limited progress, with only Rwanda notably responsive to decolonization among ten countries evaluated; 80% are 'decolonization-aware', and one is 'decolonization-blind'.

**K-12 Relevance**: Illustrates how AI governance can (or cannot) embody decolonial principles at national levels.

---

## 8. Language Bias & Multilingual AI

### Talat, Z., et al. (2025). Large language models are biased—local initiatives are fighting for change. *Nature*, 637, 776–778. https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-03891-y

**Abstract**: Despite advances, AI models continue to be geared towards the needs of English-speaking people in high-income countries. Although vast amounts of English-language data are available on the internet, data in languages such as Hindi, Arabic or Xhosa remain scarce. Testing LLM performances in other languages leads to unimpressive results, as models struggle with grammar and vocabulary and miss cultural nuances.

**K-12 Relevance**: Helps students understand how language bias in AI marginalizes non-English speakers globally.

---

### Naous, T., et al. (2023). Multilingual large language models leak human stereotypes across language boundaries. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.07141*. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07141

**Abstract**: Multilingual large language models could facilitate transmission of biases across different cultures and languages. Research demonstrates stereotype leakage within multilingual models trained on diverse linguistic datasets, with notable leakage from English to Chinese and Hindi for traits associated with "Black people," aligning with known stereotypes about African Americans in U.S. society.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates how AI perpetuates harmful stereotypes across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

---

### Müller, M. (2024). Diversity and language technology: How language modeling bias causes epistemic injustice. *Ethics and Information Technology*, 26(1). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-023-09742-6

**Abstract**: This results in language modelling biases, with multilingual systems developed from an Anglo-centric perspective deemed as working "well enough" from that dominant viewpoint, ignoring potential for westernized cultural homogenization. As the computational language gap is only superficially bridged, non-Anglophone users are left with the sole option of adapting their communication to fit the status quo, amplifying pre-existing epistemic injustices.

**K-12 Relevance**: Introduces concept of epistemic injustice through accessible language bias examples.

---

### Nekoto, W., et al. (2025). The state of large language models for African languages: Progress and challenges. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.02280*. https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02280

**Abstract**: African languages remain significantly underrepresented in current language models. Out of over 2,000 African languages, only about 42 have any support in existing LLMs, primarily those with large speaker populations or official status. Researchers developed AfroBench, a multi-task benchmark designed to evaluate LLM performance in 64 African languages, identifying major gaps in reasoning, summarization and text classification.

**K-12 Relevance**: Provides concrete data on the extent of language exclusion in AI systems.

---

## 9. Fairness, Accountability, & Transparency

### Sulaiman, S., et al. (2024). Toward fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in AI for social media and health care: Scoping review. *JMIR Medical Informatics*, 12, e50048. https://doi.org/10.2196/50048

**Abstract**: This study explores ethical use of AI and machine learning in health care information on social media platforms, critically examining these technologies from perspectives of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE). Despite diverse approaches and metrics to address FATE issues, challenges persist, including lack of a unified, comprehensive solution for fully integrating FATE principles.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates real-world applications of AI ethics principles in health contexts.

---

### Stahl, B. C., et al. (2024). Transparency and accountability in AI systems: Safeguarding wellbeing in the age of algorithmic decision-making. *Frontiers in Human Dynamics*, 6. https://doi.org/10.3389/fhumd.2024.1421273

**Abstract**: Accountability is crucial for ensuring that AI developers and deployers adhere to principles of beneficence and non-maleficence by taking responsibility for impacts of their systems and mitigating potential harms. Ensuring fairness and equity in AI systems is a central ethical concern.

**K-12 Relevance**: Provides clear framework for teaching accountability in algorithmic systems.

---

### Mehrabi, N., et al. (2021). A survey on bias and fairness in machine learning. *ACM Computing Surveys*, 54(6), 1–35.

**Abstract**: Emphasizes importance of fairness and proposes methods to detect and mitigate biases in AI systems, helping to prevent discrimination and promote inclusivity. Research identifies three major sources of algorithmic bias: data bias, method bias, and societal bias.

**K-12 Relevance**: Provides technical foundation for understanding how bias enters AI systems.

---

## 10. Participatory & Community-Based AI Design

### Costanza-Chock, S., et al. (2021). Envisioning communities: A participatory approach towards AI for social good. In *Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society* (pp. 425–436). https://doi.org/10.1145/3461702.3462612

**Abstract**: Argues that AI for social good ought to be assessed by the communities that the AI system will impact, using the capabilities approach as a guide. Shows how the capabilities approach aligns with a participatory approach for design and implementation of AI for social good research in a framework called PACT, in which community members affected should be brought in as partners and their input prioritized throughout the project.

**K-12 Relevance**: Demonstrates how students can learn to engage communities in technology design processes.

---

### Okolo, C. T., & Aruleba, K. (2022). Making AI explainable in the Global South: A systematic review. In *Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency* (pp. 1398–1408). https://doi.org/10.1145/3530190.3534802

**Abstract**: Although Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing area, most work has focused on contexts in the Global South, and little is known about if or how XAI techniques have been designed, deployed, or tested with communities in the Global South. This gap is concerning given rapidly growing enthusiasm from governments, companies, and academics to use AI/ML to "solve" problems in the Global South. Emphasizes use of participatory and co-design methods to ensure algorithmic accountability.

**K-12 Relevance**: Highlights importance of community participation in AI development and deployment.

---

### Mutanga, M., et al. (2024). Data-driven framework for aligning artificial intelligence with inclusive development in the Global South. *Sustainability*, 16(21), 9360. https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219360

**Abstract**: AI is reshaping social, political, economic, and cultural life, yet its developmental value in the Global South remains contingent on governance, participation, and design choices. This research develops and validates a data-driven framework that aligns AI with inclusive development across four interdependent dimensions—access, agency, accountability, and adaptation—using mixed methods including participatory workshops.

**K-12 Relevance**: Provides framework for teaching students about inclusive and participatory AI development.
