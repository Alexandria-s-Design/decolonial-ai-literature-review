## Key Takeaways for K-12 Education

### Why Decolonial AI Matters for Students

1. **AI is not neutral** — It reflects and amplifies existing power structures and historical inequalities
2. **Multiple knowledge systems** — Western/Anglo-centric AI excludes valuable epistemologies from around the world
3. **Student agency** — Young people can develop critical literacies to resist and reimagine algorithmic systems
4. **Community participation** — Affected communities should be centered in AI design and governance
5. **Intersectional analysis** — AI harms operate across race, gender, class, language, ability, and other dimensions

### Curriculum Integration Points

- **Computer Science** — Critical technical practices, ethical data curation, bias detection
- **Social Studies** — Historical continuities between colonialism and algorithmic colonialism
- **English/Language Arts** — Critical media literacy, algorithmic literacy, narrative analysis
- **STEM Ethics** — Participatory design, community-based research, Indigenous knowledge systems
- **Digital Citizenship** — Data sovereignty, privacy rights, algorithmic accountability
